# Goals and Heuristics in Problem Solving

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed as a final project for the *PSYCH-469: Psychology of Reasoning* course at the University of Washington during Winter 2016. The project requirements were to design and conduct a small-scale behavioral experiment, and to produce a paper containing the results and analysis.

## Abstract
In the context of problem-solving, a normative answer is not always practical for humans: we must often balance the costs of processing time, cognitive load, and accuracy by using heuristics. I conduct a between-subjects study which aims to explore whether or not being presented with different goals will affect human problem solversâ€™ use of heuristics. I find that goal does indeed have an effect on heuristic use, and that a goal which explicitly emphasizes accuracy elicits solutions with greater resemblance to normative solutions.
